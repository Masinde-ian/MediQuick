The most common application appears to be for muscle soreness and relaxation by way of taking an Epsom salt bath. In addition to Epsom baths, this material is found in several hair and skin beauty products to yield exfoliating or volumizing properties.",
    "fullDescription": "Description\n\nEpsom salt is also known as magnesium sulfate. It is a chemical compound made up of magnesium, sulfur, and oxygen.\nWhen Epsom salt is dissolved in water, it releases magnesium and sulfate ions.\nThe idea is that these particles can be absorbed through your skin, providing you with magnesium and sulfates ? which serve important bodily functions.\nHow to use\nEpsom salt can be taken by mouth as a magnesium supplement or as a laxative.\nMost brands recommend taking 2?6 teaspoons (10?30 grams) per day, dissolved in water, as a maximum for adults.\nApproximately 1?2 teaspoons (5?10 grams) is generally enough for children.\nConsult with your doctor if you need a more individualized dosage or if you want to increase the dose to more than what is listed on the package.\nUnless you have the consent of a doctor, never ingest more than the upper limit of intake stated on the package. Taking more than you need could lead to magnesium sulfate poisoning.\nIf you want to begin taking Epsom salt by mouth, start slowly. Try consuming 1?2 teaspoons (5?10 grams) at a time and gradually increase the dose as needed.\nPrecautions\nIf you use it as a laxative, make sure to drink plenty of water, which may reduce digestive discomfort.",

    "fullDescription": "Description\n\n\nExpert nutrition for mother and baby\nPregnacare prenatal supplement is the most popular and trusted by mums to safeguard the diet of those who are planning for pregnancy or are already pregnant. A scientifically developed formulation of 19 important vitamins and minerals, Pregnacare contains 400?g folic acid and 10?g vitamin D, Pregnacare has been carefully developed by experts so that all ingredient levels are within safe levels for pregnancy and are moderate rather than excessive.\nRecommended level of folic acid & vitamin D\nThe UK Department of Health recommends women planning a baby should take a supplement containing 400?g of folic acid from the start of trying to conceive until the 12th week of pregnancy. This is the exact amount of folic acid contained in Pregnacare.Supplemental folic acid intake increases maternal folate status?. Low maternal folate status is a risk factor in the development of neural tube defects in the developing foetus.Folic Acid is also beneficial beyond 12 weeks as it contributes to maternal tissue growth during pregnancy.\n \nMore than folic acid alone – with B12 and key minerals\nMany studies show the importance of ensuring the correct intake of various vitamins and minerals throughout the entire pregnancy and as part of an aftercare plan. Pregnacare provides a range of nutrients for overall support, all at sensible, carefully balanced levels, including vitamins B2, B6 and B12 which contribute to normal red blood cell formation.\nPregnacare avoids high dose iron which is not recommended\nUnlike many prenatal iron supplements, Pregnacare has been specifically formulated with an ideal, moderate level of iron. High levels of iron are not recommended unless there is a particular requirement as identified by your healthcare professional.\nBefore conception\nPregnacare is recommended before conception to build up the stores of nutrients such as iron in women who are trying for a baby. Good nutrition is important to help prepare a woman’s body for the additional demands placed on it during pregnancy. Certain nutrients, like folic acid, vitamin B12 and zinc are also of particular importance from the very first moment of conception. Zinc contributes to normal fertility and reproduction whilst vitamin B12 contributes to normal red blood cell formation and also has a role in the process of cell division.\nFor all of pregnancy\nGood nutritional intake is vital throughout pregnancy, not just the first 12 weeks. Pregnacare provides essential nutrients throughout pregnancy including folic acid which plays an important role during the full nine months and contributes to normal blood formation. You can start taking Pregnacare at any point during pregnancy.\nSpecially formulated by experts\nPregnacare has been formulated by experts to help safeguard a mother’s diet during pregnancy. It provides a comprehensive spectrum of essential nutrients at carefully chosen safe levels, developed on the basis of international research. It has always contained the recommended level of 400?g folic acid**.\n \n?The beneficial effect is obtained with a supplemental folic acid daily intake of 400mcg for at least one month before and up to three months after conception.\n** Folic acid contributes to maternal tissue growth during pregnancy. Pregnacare has always contained 400mcg folic acid, the level recommended for all women from the start of trying to conceive until the 12th week of pregnancy.\n \nThis information is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health professionals regarding anymedical condition.",

    "fullDescription": "Description\n\nOsteocare is the UK’s no.1 calcium formula and has been scientifically developed on the basis of the very latest research to provide a rich source of calcium, magnesium and zinc which contribute to the maintenance of normal bone plus vitamin D which helps with the normal absorption and utilisation of calcium by the body.\nOsteocare Glucosamine contains the preferred D3 form of Vitamin D. Vitamin D3, also known as cholecalciferol, is the form of vitamin D that is produced by the skin on exposure to sunlight. D3 is the preferred form of vitamin D because it is the specific form made in the human body and therefore more effective than D2 which is found in some supplements.\nCartilage health\nCartilage is the flexible connective tissue found between bones. Vitamin C contributes to normal collagen formation for the normal function of bones and cartilage. Osteocare Glucosamine also provides copper which contributes to the maintenance of normal connective tissues, plus Glucosamine, Chondroitin and Ginger Root extract.\nCalcium is important for everyone\nEnsuring an adequate intake of calcium is vital for men and women of all ages, as evidence suggests that healthy practices early in life, including the adequate consumption of calcium and trace elements, contribute to normal bone health and optimal bone mineralisation. Peak bone mass, obtained during childhood and adolescent growth is known to be of major importance in maintaining bones later in life.",

    "fullDescription": "Description\n\nIntelligent all round nutrition for women\nWellwoman is the original vitamin developed just for women and has been formulated for the demands of modern life and to give support to the areas of health which are of most relevance to women. The comprehensive daily multivitamin contains a wide range of nutrients and trace elements including Evening Primrose and Starflower Oil.\nAll-round Support\nWellwoman contains a spectrum of micronutrients for all-round nutritional support including vitamins B6, B12 and iron which contribute to normal energy release. Folate, pantothenic acid and vitamin B12 also contribute to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue.\nFemale Health\nEvening Primrose and Starflower Oils are included in Wellwoman along with a wide range of nutrients and trace elements to support the areas of health which are of most interest to women. The formulation contains vitamin B6 which contributes to the regulation of hormonal activity, plus iron which contributes to the normal formation of red blood cells and haemoglobin, an important consideration during the monthly cycle. Also includes 400mcg folic acid which contributes to maternal tissue growth during pregnancy which is important if you’re planning a pregnancy or there’s a chance you might get pregnant.\nImmune Health\nLooking after your immune health is important throughout the year, not only in the winter months. Wellwoman includes selenium and zinc which contribute to the normal function of the immune system. Vitamin B6 and B12 also contribute to the normal functioning of the nervous system.\nSkin, Hair & Nails\nMost of us would like a little extra support for our skin, hair and nails. Vitamin C is included in the formulation as it contributes to normal collagen formation for the normal function of skin. Collagen is the substance that gives skin its elasticity. Plus biotin, niacin (vit. B3), zinc and riboflavin (vit. B2) all contribute to the maintenance of normal skin. Zinc also contributes to the maintenance of normal nails and biotin contributes to the maintenance of normal hair.\nScientifically balanced\nBased on years of international clinical research, the comprehensive Wellwoman formula is well balanced, even including the exact level of folic acid recommended by the Department of Health for women from the first day of conception to the twelfth week of pregnancy – because women of child-bearing age sometimes need nutritional support before they even know they are pregnant.\n \nThis information is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

    "fullDescription": "Description\n\n\nComprehensive supplement for kids\nWellkid Immune Chewable tablets have been produced with children’s specific needs in mind to provide a comprehensive range of 24 nutrients to help safeguard your child’s nutritional intake.\nWellkid Immune Chewable includes vitamins A, C and D,\n \nImmune system support\nWellkid Immune Chewable contains vitamin D, which contributes to normalimmune system function in children.It also contains supporting botanical ingredients including citrus bioflavonoids, natural carotenoids and vegetarian flaxseed oil.\nSupport for rapid development\nWellkid Immune Chewable is formulated with iodine which contributes to normalgrowthin children, plus vitamin D. Vitamin D is needed fornormal growth and development of bones in children.The vitamin D in Wellkid Immune Chewable is included in the form vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) that is naturally produced by the skin when exposed to direct sunlight.\nCalcium is an essential mineral, also needed for normal growth and development of bone in children. However, it has not been included in the Wellkid Immune Chewable formula, as it is not possible to include the right amount in one tablet. For mothers particularly concerned about the normal bone health of their children we recommend Wellkid Calcium Liquid, which can be taken alongside Wellkid Immune Chewable and contains calcium and vitamin D.\nThe challenges of healthy eating\nGrowth is especially rapid during the first 12 years of a child’s life. Continuous development of bones, muscles, blood and the brain mean that children have a high nutrient requirement compared to their body size. Meeting those nutritional requirements can be a challenge, as it is common for children to be fussy eaters. You may experience your child refusing to eat certain foods, disliking certain tastes or textures, or being reluctant to try new foods. Children usually grow out of fussy eating and in the meantime nutritional supplements such as Wellkid Immune Chewable tablets can help safeguard a child’s nutritional intake as part of a balanced diet.\nGovernment surveys have indicated that children’s diets can be low in certain nutrients such as iron, which contributes tonormal cognitive development of children.This is especially true for vegetarians, as iron from non-meat sources may not be as easily absorbed by the body. Wellkid Immune Chewable tablets are formulated with moderate levels of iron and are suitable for vegetarians.",

Taking a daily dose of 2500–5000 mcg of biotin helps enhance the thickness and strength of hair and nails, helping to prevent painful nail splitting.\nAs the body’s most abundant protein, collagen is also essential for the proper structure of healthy skin, hair, nails, bones, and joints. Collagen makes up 75% of the dry mass of the dermis, but collagen synthesis declines dramatically as we age and collagen is degraded by micro-trauma, ultraviolet light (sun) exposure, smoking, and soft tissue injury. A lack of collagen causes skin to become thin, dry, saggy, and weak, resulting in visible signs of aging, including wrinkles and fine lines.\nVerisol stimulates skin cells to produce collagen and elastin, promoting healthier, younger-looking skin. By increasing collagen and elastin in skin, Verisol enhances skin moisture and elasticity, and can reduce deep wrinkles within 30 days.\nCollagen 30 with Biotin provides effective daily support for healthy skin, hair, and nails, promoting natural beauty from the inside out.\nMedicinal ingredients \nEach tablet contains:\nVerisol® Bioactive Collagen PeptidesTM Type I and III Hydrolyzed Collagen (bovine) 833.34 mg\nBiotin 1666.67 mcg\nNon Medicinal Ingredients \nCoating (carbohydrate gum, glycerin), stearic acid, hydroxypropylcellulose, vegetable grade magnesium stearate (lubricant).\nDosage \nRecommended dosage (adults): 1 tablet 3 times daily or as directed by a physician.\nAllergen\nFree of artificial colours, preservatives, or sweeteners; no dairy, starch, sugar, wheat, gluten, yeast, soy, corn,egg, fish, shellfish, salt, tree nuts, or GMOs.\nCaution \nConsult a physician prior to use if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

    "fullDescription": "Description\n\nHumans are one of the few mammals who cannot make their own Vitamin C, so we need to ensure that the correct levels of this essential Vitamin are consumed every day. Including Vitamin C rich foods in your diet, such as oranges, kiwi, red peppers, strawberries and sweet potatoes, is one way to keep your body healthy. Food supplements can also be used to help ‘top-up’ and are especially handy during those times when your diet is not supplying everything your body needs.\nThere are many different forms of Vitamin C, with the most common form found in supplements being Ascorbic Acid. Some people find this form of Vitamin C too acidic, especially those with sensitive stomachs. At Natures Aid, our Low Acid Vitamin C 1000mg tablets have been carefully formulated by our expert nutritionists. This low acid formulation combines Ascorbic Acid with more gentle forms of Vitamin C, such as Calcium Ascorbate, and Sodium Ascorbate, resulting in a product that is gentle on the tummy while still providing 1000mg of Vitamin C per tablet.\nOur Low Acid Vitamin C 1000mg tablets are vegan-friendly and also free from GMO. They also contain no yeast, gluten, dairy or soya, to provide you with the peace of mind you need. These high-strength tablets are not suitable for those who struggle to swallow larger pills.\nCode: Vitamin C 1000mg Low Acid",

This blend offers 550 mg of turmeric powder with 50 mg turmeric extract standardized to 95% curcuminoids. Curcuminoids are the primary active constituents of turmeric that are responsible for its colour, and the therapeutic effects of turmeric.\nFor 4,000 years, turmeric (Curcuma longa) has been used in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines for its numerous health benefits. Curcumin, for example, is able to block more than 30 different inflammation pathways and can inhibit the production of pain-inducing compounds such as cyclooxygenase-2. It’s no surprise, then, that turmeric has long been prized as a natural way to reduce joint stiffness, swelling, and pain associated with osteoarthritis.\nTurmeric also provides antioxidant protection to neutralize free radicals, and aids normal liver and gall bladder function. By supporting digestive and liver health, turmeric can help provide temporary relief from occasional indigestion or dyspepsia.\nTurmeric Curcumin offers a natural way to promote a balanced inflammatory response while providing powerful antioxidant protection. It is ideal for overall health and well-being.\nMedicinal Ingredients \nEach vegetarian capsule contains:\nTurmeric Powder (Curcuma longa) (rhizome) 550 mg\nTurmeric Extract 50:1 (Curcuma longa) (95% curcuminoids) 50 mg\n(Equivalent to 3,050 mg of total raw turmeric)\nNon Medicinal Ingredients \nVegetarian capsulen(carbohydrate gum, purified water), microcrystalline cellulose, vegetable grade magnesium stearate (lubricant), silica.\nDosage \nRecommended dosage (adults): 1 capsule daily or as directed by a physician.\nAllergen Statement\nFree of artificial colours, preservatives, or sweeteners; nodairy, starch, sugar, wheat, gluten, yeast, soy, corn, egg, fish, shellfish, animal products, salt,tree nuts,or GMOs.

    "fullDescription": "Description\n\n \nWellwoman 50+ has been specifically designed to help safeguard the nutritional needs of women aged 50 and above it contains a comprehensive range of 26 vitamins, minerals and plant derived nutrients to support key areas of health important to women over 50, including heart, brain and eye health.\nSupporting an Active Lifestyle\nGetting older shouldn’t mean you should have to change your lifestyle and the activities you have always enjoyed. Wellwoman 50+ contains vitamins B6, pantothenic acid and iron which contribute to the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. Vitamin B2 and copper contribute to normal energy release. Immune health is also a serious consideration as you get older. Zinc, selenium and vitamins B6, B12, C and D have also been included in the formula as they contribute to the normal function of the immune system.\nNormal Vision\nYour eyes are one of the most complex organs and as you get older it’s even more important than ever to look after them. The retina and the lens can be damaged over the years by exposure to sunlight, smoke and pollution. Wellwoman 50+ provides vitamin C and E which contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress plus mineral zinc, which contributes to the maintenance of normal vision.\nHeart and Circulation\nWellwoman 50+ contains thiamin (vit.B1) which contributes to the normal function of the heart as well as a combination of folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 which contribute to normal homocysteine metabolism, and normal red blood cell formation. The formula also includes vitamin C which increases non-haem (plant source) iron absorption. This is especially important with vegetarian diets as iron contributes to the normal formation of haemoglobin and normal oxygen transport in the body to all the major organs.\nBrain and Nervous System\nThiamin (vit. B1) and vitamins B6 and B12 with biotin and vitamin C contribute to the maintenance of normal function of the nervous system, combined with pantothenic acid which contributes to normal mental performance.\n \nThis information is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

It helps to increase sperm count, improve sperm motility and contribute to normal sperm morphology. The formula is a food supplement for dietary management in men with impaired fertility who want to have children.\nProblems with male infertility are mostly a consequence of disturbances in spermatogenesis (the physiological process of formation and maturation of sperm), which is expressed in a quantitative and qualitative reduction of mature sperm. This means that the number, quantity or motility of mature sperm are seriously reduced compared with normal values required for successful fertilization. In most cases, it is a combination of all 3 factors. Unlike women, who have many options for therapy, options for men are very limited and are expressed in the improvement of only one key factor ? the quality of semen. It is extremely difficult to improve the poor quality of sperm by taking drugs. However, studies have shown that certain micro-nutrients can have a positive effect on the quantity, motility and formation of sperm, thereby fertility in men can be optimized nutrient-physiological way. Spermatogenesis is a complex biological process, which lasts a few weeks (usually about twelve). During this process, the body needs a variety of essential nutrients to support different stages of the development of spermatozoa, such as vitamins, vitamin-like substances, trace elements, minerals and amino acids. Only those specific substances can provide optimal conditions for normal and complete spermatogenesis. Men with impaired fertility have elevated needs of these substances. A balanced combination of specific nutrients in a regular and streamlined intake in sufficient amounts is able to positively influence the process of spermatogenesis.\nDosage administration\nThree capsules once daily with meals.",

The active component in Turmeric is Curcumin, which is responsible for the spices distinctive yellow colour. \nBromelain is the name given to a group of enzymes found within pineapple juice and pineapple stems. These enzymes can digest protein, this is why the strength of bromelain is described by its ability to digest the protein gelatine.

    "fullDescription": "Description\n\nThey can also be used for diarrhoea associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) following guidance from your doctor.\nHow does Imodium work?\nWhen something upsets the natural balance of nutrients and water absorption in your intestines, your digestive system starts to work too fast. This leads to the frequent passing of loose, watery stools, known as diarrhoea. Contrary to popular belief, Imodium doesn’t work by stopping your bowel movements. Instead, it contains an active ingredient called ‘loperamide’, which works by calming your digestive system down. This helps your digestive system get back to normal, leading to firmer stools. By restoring this delicate balance, you can feel better sooner and have the confidence to get on with your day.",

    "description": "Even greater nutritional care from Visionace\nThe importance of Omega-3 fatty acids\nOmega-3 fatty acids are a special class of polyunsaturated fatty acids which are commonly found in plant seed oils, nut oils and oily fish such as sardines and salmon. A large number of scientific studies worldwide have highlighted the multiple benefits of dietary Omega-3 fatty acids in areas as diverse as heart, brain, and normal vision. The two most researched Omega-3 fatty acids are Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). DHA contributes to the maintenance of normal vision1.\nDHA in the retina\nOmega-3 fatty acids play an important structural and functional role in the retina, the part of the eye that detects light. DHA is a component of photoreceptor cells which are responsible for converting light into nerve signals. Photoreceptors contain the highest concentration of DHA of any cell in the body, with DHA accounting for over 50% of the total fatty acid content2 3. Adequate levels of DHA must be maintained for the retina to continue to function properly and to maintain normal vision)4 5.\nThe retinal cells are continually being renewed, so a constant supply of Omega-3 fatty acids and in particular DHA is required6 7. Since these cannot be made by the body a lack of these in the diet can have a direct effect on levels in the retina8. Fortunately increasing dietary intake can help to restore retinal Omega-3 levels9. Omega-3 fatty acids are now being recognised as being essential for normal eye health from before birth continuing into old age10.\nProtection of cells\nThe macular is the central area of the retina, and contains the highest density of photoreceptors. The retinal cells of the macular are particularly vulnerable to the effects of UV rays in sunlight which can result in cellular damage11 12. Because of this, sunglasses with a high Eye-Sun Protection Factor (E-SPF) are always recommended to reduce the exposure of the eye to excessive light and harmful UV rays.\nVisionace Plus provides vitamins C and E plus minerals zinc and selenium which contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress.\nLutein Esters\nLutein belongs to a class of compounds called carotenoids and is the dominant pigment in the retina. Visionace Plus provides a total of 12mg of Lutein Esters.\nQuality and Purity Guaranteed\nOnly the purest pharmaceutical grade fish oil is used in Visionace Plus. To ensure maximum benefit, the oil is carefully concentrated to increase its DHA and EPA content and further purified. Each batch is rigorously tested, certified, and fully compliant with stringent EC and WHO rules on environmental pollutants.",

Vitamin D3, also known as cholecalciferol, is the form of vitamin D that is produced by the skin on exposure to sunlight.

Peak bone mass, obtained during childhood and adolescent growth is known to be of major importance in maintaining bones later in life. The UK Department of Health recommends that everyone should consider taking a daily supplement containing of vitamin D, particularly during autumn and winter.\nCalcium is vital for older women\nBoth sexes lose bone mass during their lifetime but after the menopause women usually lose bone mass much faster than men.\nPostmenopausal women have an increased risk of bone loss for three reasons:\n– Bone mineral content tends to be lower in women than in men\n– Dietary calcium intake may decrease with age\n– The rate of bone loss accelerates at menopause\nHave difficulty swallowing tablets?\nThis liquid formula is ideal for those who have difficulty with swallowing tablets, and provides calcium, magnesium, vitamin D and zinc which contribute to the maintenance of normal bone health. Getting enough calcium is especially important for men and women over 50, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and during and after the menopause.\nChildren’s growth and development\nWith a delicious orange taste, Osteocare Liquid is ideal for children. Osteocare liquid provides calcium and vitamin D which are needed for normal growth and development of bone in children.\nDairy and fat free\nOsteocare Liquid contains no dairy products and is 100% fat free.

Good sleep quality is essential for maintaining physical and cognitive health; however, travelling, shift work, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and other factors can disrupt melatonin production, leading to sleep difficulties and eventually to daytime drowsiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland in the brain. It safely and effectively resets the body’s “biological clock” – helping you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and wake up feeling refreshed. Melatonin also supports the essential restorative REM phase of sleep to help reduce daytime fatigue.\nEach sublingual tablet delivers 3 mg of melatonin derived from non-animal sources. The delicious peppermint flavoured quick dissolve tablet is convenient for adults looking to find an alternative to taking the tablet form. Supplemental melatonin is non-addictive and safe for most adults when taken as directed. This is an ideal formula for anyone seeking a natural aid for sleep deprivation, fatigue, jet lag, and age-related declines in melatonin.

Do not drive or use machinery for 5 hours after taking melatonin. If symptoms persist continuously for more than 4 weeks (chronic insomnia), consult a physician.

They are commonly found in plant oils and from marine animals. Other sources of omega 3 include fish and eggs from chicken fed on DHA and EPA sources. Humans and other mammals are unable to synthesize omega 3 and can only be obtained through diet. Omega 3 may improve heart health by: Decreasing triglycerides’ High triglycerides may contribute to the hardening of the blood vessels or thickening of the vessel walls ( a condition called arteriosclerosis) which increases the risk of stroke, heart attack and heart disease. Extremely high triglycerides can also cause acute swelling of the pancreas (pancreatitis) Blood pressure’ By reducing blood clotting, Omega 3 leads to a reduced risk of blood clots because it helps prevent blood platelets from clumping together. Caution should be observed if you are taking blood thinners. Talk to your pharmacist if you are on blood thinners such as warfarin, Xarelto, clexane,procorolan, plavix among others. Decreasing your risk of strokes and heart failure’ It reduces the risks by reducing your blood pressure and blood coagulation. Reducing irregular heartbeats’ People with higher-than-average levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood may be roughly 30 percent less likely than those with the lowest levels to develop irregular heartbeat (a condition known as arrhythmia)",

The first studies carried out in the 1970s showed that Greenlandians, who consume large amounts of fatty fish, actually did not suffer from cardiovascular diseases and did not have atherosclerosis. Other vital signs of health, such as triglycerides level, blood pressure and pulse, were also better than other groups have. The most important fatty acids among all Omega-3 are Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA has a powerful anti-inflammatory effect and, according to clinical researches, can reduce the risk of heart disease, rheumatism and even cancer. At the same time, DHA plays an important role in heart and brain health.",

Sambucol uses only specific European Elderberries (Sambucus Nigra) for our syrups. Black Elderberries have been recognized for centuries for their immune-supportive properties.

    "description": "any people will agree that looking after your eyes is one of the most important things you can do.  As we age our eyesight may start to deteriorate, and many may regard this as inevitable.  However, research has indicated that diet and lifestyle can help to reduce the risk of eye problems as we age.\nThe most important lifestyle changes you can make to look after your eyes include:\n?         Stop smoking\n?         Wear sunglasses\n?         Get regular eye checks\n?         Protect your eyes from computer related eye strain by taking regular breaks.\nIn your diet look to include plenty of colourful fruits and vegetables, this means carrots, peppers, sweet potatoes, and green leafy vegetables.  Oily fish, nuts, seeds, beans and pulses all provide important nutrients, as would eggs, seafood and even red meat (if you eat it). \nTo help support your diet and lifestyle efforts the nutritional experts at Natures Aid have also created our Lutein Eye Complex.  This specialist multi-nutrient combines Lutein, Bilberry and Mixed Carotenoids with:\n?         Vitamin B2 and Zinc both these nutrients contribute to the maintenance of normal vision.\n?         Vitamin C, which supports normal collagen formation for the normal function of the blood vessels\n?         Vitamin E and Selenium which contribute to the protection of cells from oxidative stress.\nTo provide you with the peace of mind you are looking for when choosing to take a food supplement, we can also assure you that our Lutein Eye Complex is vegan friendly, GMO free and contains none of the common allergens, so is free from gluten, dairy, nuts, yeast and soya.",

It acts as a powerful antioxidant, protecting cell membranes against damage caused by free radicals (as a result of pollution or solar ultraviolet radiation) and therefore helps to prevent skin aging.\nIt also supports the immune system and inhibits platelet aggregation, depending on the dose. It is also involved in the regulation of several enzymes. Cells use vitamin E to interact with each other and carry out important bodily functions such as maintaining vision and/or movement in muscles and nerves.\nVitamin E can be found in foods such as olive, sunflower or sesame vegetable oils; in nuts (hazelnuts or almonds); it is also present, to a lesser extent, in vegetables (such as spinach and broccoli). Some manufacturers add vitamin E for its antioxidant benefits. Before taking a dietary supplement containing vitamin E, consult a healthcare professional.\nIn cosmetic products, its antioxidant effect is also utilised, and it is included in the formulation of skincare products (tocopherol and derivatives). It is an anti-inflammatory vitamin and counteracts oxidative damage and preserves collagen in the dermis, helping to maintain skin structure. It is also found in anti-aging products combined with Vitamin C as it manages to regenerate the anti-ox effect of Vitamin E and results in a good antioxidant synergy.Brain function.\nImmunodefense system.\nInflammation reactions.\n*This supplement is not a substitute for a healthy, balanced diet.",

Although the body can make omega-9 EFAs, they play an important role in cardiovascular health. Healthy ratios of omega-3s to omega-6s range from 1:1 to 4:1; however, the typical North American diet provides ratios of up to 30:1. Supplementing with a combination of omega-rich fish and plant oils ensures your body receives the correct balance of fats needed to maintain optimal health.

It may also be used in certain patients to make sure they are getting enough calcium (such as women who are pregnant, nursing, or postmenopausal, people taking certain medications such as phenytoin, phenobarbital, or prednisone).Calcium plays a very important role in the body.
